Built a digit recognition system using TensorFlow, training a neural network to accurately predict the labels
of hand-drawn images of numerals 0-9.

Achieved an impressive accuracy by successfully training the neural network on the MNIST dataset and
testing it on a sample image.
Leveraged TensorFlow, an open-source Python toolkit for deep learning, to implement and fine-tune the
object recognition mode
